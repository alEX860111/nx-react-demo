# nx-react-demo

This project demonstrates how to build a simple todo-application with [react](https://reactjs.org/), [nx](https://nx.dev/l/r/react/overview) and the [material ui component library](https://mui.com/).

React [hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) and functional components are leveraged in the whole project and unit-testing is done with [react-testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro).
